# Nexus-Core Railway Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed syntax error in signup page**
   - The image tag in `/app/signup/page.tsx` was missing its closing bracket
   - Fixed duplicate className attributes

2. **Eliminated conflicting Nixpacks configurations**
   - Removed `nixpacks.toml` to prevent conflicts with `nixpacks.json` 
   - Standardized on a single configuration file

3. **Enhanced Nixpacks configuration**
   - Added essential build dependencies: python3, libc6-compat, make, g++
   - Improved build process with better error handling
   - Added explicit environment variable copying

4. **Updated environment variables**
   - Fixed URLs to match the Railway domain (nexus-app-production.up.railway.app)
   - Updated NextAuth secret
   - Removed hardcoded database URLs

5. **Enhanced Next.js configuration**
   - Updated image domains for Railway URL
   - Enabled SWC minification for better performance
   - Added console removal for production builds

## Deployment Status

The application is now deployed at:
https://nexus-app-production.up.railway.app

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment, check:

1. **Database connection**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL in the Railway variables is correctly configured
   - Make sure Prisma schema is compatible with Railway's PostgreSQL version

2. **Redis connection**
   - Check REDIS_URL in the Railway variables

3. **Build failures**
   - Check the build logs at the Railway dashboard
   - Look for specific error messages related to dependencies or configuration

4. **Runtime errors**
   - View logs in the Railway dashboard to identify issues

## Future Improvements

1. Add CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments
2. Implement database migrations as part of the build process
3. Add robust health checks for the application
4. Configure monitoring and alerts
