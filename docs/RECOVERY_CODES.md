# Recovery Codes System Documentation

## Overview

The Recovery Codes system provides a secure fallback authentication mechanism for users who have enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This system is designed and implemented following SOC2 compliance requirements to ensure the highest level of security and auditability.

## Security Procedures and Policies

### Code Generation
- Recovery codes are generated using cryptographically secure random number generation
- Each code is unique and one-time use only
- Codes are 10 characters long with a format of XXXX-XXXX-XX
- Users receive 10 backup codes upon MFA enrollment
- Codes are stored using secure one-way hashing (Argon2id)

### Storage Security
- Recovery codes are stored in a dedicated `RecoveryCodes` table
- Each code is individually hashed before storage
- Codes are associated with user accounts via secure foreign keys
- Database access is encrypted and access-controlled
- Regular security audits are performed on the storage system

### Usage Policies
- Codes can only be used once and are immediately invalidated after use
- Users must re-authenticate before viewing or generating new codes
- Failed attempts are logged and monitored for security
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent brute force attacks
- Users are notified via email when a recovery code is used

## Incident Response Procedures

### Suspicious Activity Detection
1. Monitor for:
   - Multiple failed recovery code attempts
   - Unusual geographic locations
   - Out-of-hours usage
   - Rapid successive attempts

2. Automated Response:
   - Lock account after 3 failed attempts
   - Send real-time alerts to security team
   - Log detailed forensic information
   - Notify user of suspicious activity

### Security Incident Handling
1. Initial Assessment
   - Identify affected users and systems
   - Determine breach scope and impact
   - Preserve forensic evidence

2. Containment
   - Temporarily disable compromised accounts
   - Revoke active recovery codes
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Enable enhanced monitoring

3. Investigation
   - Review audit logs and access patterns
   - Analyze attack vectors and methods
   - Document incident timeline
   - Identify security gaps

4. Recovery
   - Reset affected user credentials
   - Generate new recovery codes
   - Restore account access
   - Update security measures

5. Post-Incident
   - Document incident details
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct team debrief
   - Implement preventive measures
