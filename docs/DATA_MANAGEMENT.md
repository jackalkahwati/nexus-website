# Data Management System

This document outlines the data management system, which includes automated backup, data retention, and database maintenance procedures.

## Components

### 1. Backup Service
- Automated daily backups
- Configurable retention period
- Compression support
- Table exclusion options
- Audit logging of all backup operations

### 2. Data Retention Service
- GDPR compliance support
- Configurable retention rules per table
- Multiple deletion strategies (soft/hard delete)
- Data anonymization options
- Audit logging of all retention operations

### 3. Database Maintenance Service
- Automated table analysis
- Smart vacuum operations based on bloat detection
- Index optimization
- Performance monitoring
- Audit logging of all maintenance operations

## Schedule

The system runs the following automated tasks:

- **Daily Backup**: Runs at 1 AM
- **Weekly Data Retention**: Runs on Sunday at 2 AM
- **Daily Database Maintenance**: Runs at 3 AM

## Configuration

### Backup Configuration
```typescript
{
  backupDir: './backups',
  retentionDays: 30,
  compressionLevel: 6,
  excludedTables: ['audit_logs']
}
```

### Data Retention Configuration
```typescript
{
  rules: [
    {
      table: 'users',
      field: 'last_login',
      retention: 365, // days
      gdprSensitive: true
    },
    {
      table: 'sessions',
      field: 'created_at',
      retention: 30,
      deleteStrategy: 'hard'
    }
  ],
  defaultRetention: 365,
  defaultStrategy: 'soft'
}
```

### Database Maintenance Configuration
```typescript
{
  analyzeFrequency: 7, // days
  vacuumFrequency: 7,
  reindexFrequency: 30,
  maxTableBloat: 20, // percentage
  maxIndexBloat: 30
}
```

## Usage

### Automated Scheduling
The system automatically schedules tasks using node-schedule. No manual intervention is required after initial setup.

### Manual Operations

#### Full Maintenance
```typescript
import { performFullMaintenance } from '../scripts/data-management'

await performFullMaintenance()
```

#### GDPR Requests
```typescript
import { handleGDPRRequest } from '../scripts/data-management'

// Export user data
const userData = await handleGDPRRequest(userId, 'export')

// Delete user data
await handleGDPRRequest(userId, 'delete')
```

## Monitoring

All operations are logged using the system's logging infrastructure:
- Success/failure status
- Operation duration
- Error details (if any)
- Audit trail for compliance

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Error logging with full context
- Alert notifications for critical failures
- Graceful degradation when components fail

## Best Practices

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Keep at least 30 days of backups
   - Test backup restoration periodically
   - Monitor backup size and duration

2. **Data Retention**
   - Review retention rules quarterly
   - Document all GDPR-related operations
   - Maintain audit logs of data deletion

3. **Database Maintenance**
   - Monitor table bloat regularly
   - Schedule intensive operations during low-traffic periods
   - Keep index statistics up to date

## Security Considerations

1. **Backup Security**
   - Backups are compressed and can be encrypted
   - Access to backup files is restricted
   - Backup locations are configurable

2. **Data Privacy**
   - GDPR compliance built-in
   - Data anonymization support
   - Audit logging for all operations

3. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging of all administrative actions
   - Secure configuration management

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Failed Backups**
   - Check disk space
   - Verify database permissions
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Slow Maintenance**
   - Review table bloat
   - Check for long-running queries
   - Monitor system resources

3. **Data Retention Issues**
   - Verify retention rules
   - Check for locked records
   - Review deletion strategies

## Contributing

When contributing to the data management system:

1. Follow the existing code style
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation
4. Test thoroughly before submitting changes

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements:

1. **Backup System**
   - Cloud storage integration
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Parallel backup processing

2. **Data Retention**
   - More granular retention rules
   - Enhanced compliance reporting
   - Automated compliance checks

3. **Database Maintenance**
   - Machine learning for optimization
   - Predictive maintenance
   - Enhanced performance analytics
