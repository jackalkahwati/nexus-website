# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Next.js application with API routes
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Prisma for database operations
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- Authentication system with NextAuth.js and MFA support
- API key-based authentication for external access
- Middleware for security, monitoring, and rate limiting

## Key Technical Decisions
- Server-side rendering with Next.js for improved performance and SEO
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Real-time updates using SSE for notifications, collaboration, and fleet tracking
- Multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
- API key system for third-party integrations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- SOC2 compliance measures implemented

## Core Patterns
### Authentication & Authorization
- NextAuth.js for user authentication
- API key validation for service-to-service auth
- MFA with recovery codes
- Role-based access control
- Password policies and history tracking

### Real-time Communication
- SSE for server-to-client updates
- WebSocket for bi-directional communication
- Event-driven architecture for real-time features

### Data Management
- Prisma migrations for database schema
- Redis for caching and real-time data
- Data retention and backup policies
- Export/import capabilities

### Monitoring & Logging
- Structured logging with Winston
- Log rotation and aggregation
- Performance monitoring
- Security metrics tracking
- Audit logging for compliance

### API Design
- RESTful API endpoints
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API versioning support
- Webhook integration capabilities
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
